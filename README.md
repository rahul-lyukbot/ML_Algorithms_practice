# ML_Algorithms_practice
All algorithms with practice notbooks for help to understand with basic to advance features
This section contain all **Machine_learning** algorithm:-
  1. `Supervised learning`
  2. `Unsupervised learning`
  3. `Reinforcement learning`

Here are two CSV file which are related to Notbook 2(Feature Engineering)
  1. `ames_housing` which have missing value and outliers to deal
  2. `NO_missing_value` which was updated after several operation on `ames_housing` dataset

**ALL modification on `ames_housing` dataset based on the descryption.Text file which provide all information about dataset**

## Cross-Validation Notebook contain these Topics|Methods for cross-validation-> https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/3_Cross_Validation.ipynb
  1. Train|Test split
  2. Train|Validation|Test split
  3. Sklearn Cross_validation score
  4. Sklearn Cross_Validate

**And this Notebook also contain `GridSearch Cross-Validation`method**


## Logistic regression:   https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/4_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
in this notebook you find the two model one for binary classification and second for multclass classification
  * **there is two csv file i'll use as dataset**
    1. `hearing.csv` -> https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/hearing_test.csv for binary classification
    2. `IRIS.csv` -> https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/IRIS.csv for multiclass classification


## KNN- k-Nearest_Neighbors->  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/5_KNN.ipynb
* In this Notebokk there is 3 model:-
  * First one simple knn model wiht one n_neighbors
  * Second one by using Elbow_method to find the n_neighbors
  * Third one using **Scikit-learn** pipline and n folds method to find best n_neighbors value
