# ML_Algorithms_practice
All algorithms with practice notbooks for help to understand with basic to advance features
This section contain all **Machine_learning** algorithm:-
  1. `Supervised learning`
  2. `Unsupervised learning`
  3. `Reinforcement learning`

Here are two CSV file which are related to Notbook 2(Feature Engineering)
  1. `ames_housing` which have missing value and outliers to deal
  2. `NO_missing_value` which was updated after several operation on `ames_housing` dataset

**ALL modification on `ames_housing` dataset based on the descryption.Text file which provide all information about dataset**

## Cross-Validation Notbook contain these Topics|Methods for cross-validation
  1. Train|Test split
  2. Train|Validation|Test split
  3. Sklearn Cross_validation score
  4. Sklearn Cross_Validate

**And this Notebook also contain `GridSearch Cross-Validation`method**


## Logistic regression:   https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/4_Logistic_Regression.ipynb
in this notebook you find the two model one for binary classification and second for multclass classification
  * there is two csv file i'll use as dataset
    1. hearing.csv https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/hearing_test.csv for binary classification
    2. IRIS.csv  https://github.com/rahul-lyukbot/ML_Algorithms_practice/blob/main/IRIS.csv for multiclass classification
