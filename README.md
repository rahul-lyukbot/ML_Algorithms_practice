# ML_Algorithms_practice
All algorithms with practice notbooks for help to understand with basic to advance features
This section contain all **Machine_learning** algorithm:-
  1. `Supervised learning`
  2. `Unsupervised learning`
  3. `Reinforcement learning`

Here are two CSV file which are related to Notbook 2(Feature Engineering)
  1. `ames_housing` which have missing value and outliers to deal
  2. `NO_missing_value` which was updated after several operation on `ames_housing` dataset

**ALL modification on `ames_housing` dataset based on the descryption.Text file which provide all information about dataset**
